### Data Cleaning

With 100 different counties, 2 sex codes, 6 race codes, 2 ethnic codes, and 4 age codes, there are 9600 possible categorizations of potential voters. Out of these categories, 2087 of these categories did not have a person cast a ballot. 

```{r}
data_full %>%
  filter(Freq < total_voters) %>%
  mutate(unaccounted_voters = total_voters - Freq) %>%
  group_by(county_desc, TotalCountyPopulation) %>%
  summarise(Total_Unaccounted = sum(unaccounted_voters)) %>%
  mutate(Pct_Pop = 100*Total_Unaccounted/TotalCountyPopulation) %>%
  arrange(desc(Pct_Pop)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TotalCountyPopulation, y = Pct_Pop)) +
  geom_point()
```
